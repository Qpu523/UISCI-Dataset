# UISCI Dataset: Urban Intersection Safety-Critical Interaction Dataset

This repository hosts the **UISCI Dataset**, a large-scale, high-resolution dataset of **vehicle-pedestrian near-miss interactions at urban intersections**, generated using our proposed **Three-stage Multi-Agent SST-DDPG framework** in CARLA.

## 🧠 Framework Overview

![Framework Overview](https://github.com/Qpu523/UISCI-Dataset/blob/e9974f2cec9b20d5c204afeada061f4466bd595b/Config/Framework.png)

The three-stage framework integrates real-world data with simulation to generate realistic and diverse safety-critical scenarios.

-   **Stage 1: Pre-training with Real-World Data**
    The process begins by pre-training multi-agent state-space Transformer-enhanced DDPG (MA-SST-DDPG) agents on real-world safety-critical data. This allows the agents to learn human-like, interactive evasive behaviors from actual near-miss events.

-   **Stage 2: Online Learning in a Simulation Environment**
    The pre-trained agents are deployed in the CARLA simulator, where they encounter a wide range of high-risk scenarios. The agents continue to learn and adapt through online reinforcement learning, which refines their policies and narrows the gap between simulation and reality.

-   **Stage 3: CARLA-Based Large-Scale Data Generation**
    Using the refined and adapted model from Stage 2, we generate a large-scale dataset in CARLA across multiple intersection scenarios. This stage produces a diverse, high-resolution dataset of safety-critical interactions.
-   **Output:** A realistic and scalable dataset of over **163,000 high-resolution interaction episodes**, capturing authentic collision avoidance behaviors between vehicles and pedestrians in simulated urban intersections.

## 🗺 Simulation Environment

We simulate two intersection layouts (**A** and **B**) in CARLA's Town10. Each location contains four vehicle-pedestrian interaction scenarios involving right-turning vehicles and crossing pedestrians.

- 🟩 **Green arrow**: Pedestrian crossing direction  
- 🟥 **Red arrow**: Vehicle right-turn direction

| Scenario ID | Location | Vehicle Turn Direction | Pedestrian Direction |
|-------------|----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| ①           | A        | Right-turn             | East → West          |
| ②           |          |                        | South → North        |

## 🎯 Turing Test: Human Evaluation of Realism

A **Turing Test-inspired study** was conducted to assess whether human participants could distinguish the realism of interactions from three different sources:
-   Videos generated by our **three-stage framework (Refined MA-SST-DDPG)**
-   Videos of **real-world** interactions projected into CARLA
-   Videos from the **default CARLA autopilot**

A total of **51 participants** rated 12 randomized videos (4 per category), and their perception scores were statistically analyzed using **t-tests** and **Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) tests**.

### 📊 Table 8: Statistical Comparison of Perceptual Scores Between Video Types

| Group 1               | Group 2               | t-statistic | p-value  | KS statistic | p-value  | Significant Difference |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:------------:|:--------:|:----------------------:|
| CARLA                 | Two-Stage MA-SST-DDPG | -13.5004    | <0.0001  | 0.4951       | <0.0001  | Yes                    |
| CARLA                 | Real world            | -13.6295    | <0.0001  | 0.5294       | <0.0001  | Yes                    |
| Two-Stage MA-SST-DDPG | Real world            | -0.0902     | 0.9282   | 0.0588       | 0.8732   | No                     |

### ✅ Interpretation

Participants could **easily distinguish** the unrealistic behaviors of the **CARLA baseline** from both real-world videos and our framework's generated videos (statistically significant differences, p < 0.001).
-   There was **no statistically significant difference** in perceived realism between the **Refined MA-SST-DDPG** videos and the **real-world** videos (p = 0.9282).
-   This confirms that our model-generated interactions were perceived as **indistinguishable from real-world behaviors**, validating the high-fidelity realism of our data generation framework.
