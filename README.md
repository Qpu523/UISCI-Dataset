# UISCI Dataset: Urban Intersection Safety-Critical Interaction Dataset

This repository hosts the **UISCI Dataset**, a large-scale, high-resolution dataset of **vehicle-pedestrian near-miss interactions at urban intersections**, generated using our proposed **Two-Stage Multi-Agent SST-DDPG framework** in CARLA.

## 🧠 Framework Overview

![Framework Overview](https://github.com/Qpu523/HiRISC-Dataset/blob/7ac52fe8a27fbb071942795e77c5461db8f661d2/Config/Picture11.png)

The Two-Stage MA-SST-DDPG framework consists of:

- **Stage 1: Risk Scenario Generation using CurvTTC Trigger**  
  In diverse CARLA intersection scenarios, we simulate thousands of AV–pedestrian interactions. When the computed **Curvilinear Time-to-Collision (CurvTTC)** falls below a risk threshold, the interaction is recorded as a **near-miss trajectory**. This produces a high-quality dataset in evasive maneuvers and collision-avoidance behaviors.

- **Stage 2: MA-SST-DDPG Training with Online Learning**  
  The recorded near-miss data is used to **pre-train a multi-agent safe reinforcement learning model**. The trained policy is then deployed in the CARLA environment to **interact with new agents**, and the model is **continuously refined through online learning**, ensuring it adapts to evolving behaviors and generates diverse, realistic, and risky interaction data.
- **Output:** A realistic and scalable dataset of over **80,000 near-miss interaction episodes**, capturing **genuine collision-avoidance behaviors** between vehicles and pedestrians in simulated urban intersections.

## 🗺 Simulation Environment

![Simulation Intersections](https://github.com/Qpu523/HiRISC-Dataset/blob/7ac52fe8a27fbb071942795e77c5461db8f661d2/Config/Picture22.png)

We simulate two intersection layouts (**A** and **B**) in CARLA's Town10. Each location contains four vehicle-pedestrian interaction scenarios involving right-turning vehicles and crossing pedestrians.

- 🟩 **Green arrow**: Pedestrian crossing direction  
- 🟥 **Red arrow**: Vehicle right-turn direction

| Scenario ID | Location | Vehicle Turn Direction | Pedestrian Direction |
|-------------|----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| ①           | A        | Right-turn             | East → West          |
| ②           |          |                        | South → North        |
| ③           |          |                        | West → East          |
| ④           |          |                        | North → South        |
| ⑤           | B        | Right-turn             | East → West          |
| ⑥           |          |                        | South → North        |
| ⑦           |          |                        | West → East          |
| ⑧           |          |                        | North → South        |

## 🎯 Turing Test: Human Evaluation of Realism

We conducted a **Turing Test** to assess whether human participants could distinguish between:

- Videos generated by our **Two-Stage MA-SST-DDPG** framework
- Real-world near-miss interaction videos
- CARLA baseline simulation videos 

A total of **51 participants** rated 12 randomized videos (4 per category), and their perception scores were statistically analyzed using **t-tests** and **Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) tests**.

### 📊 Table 8: Statistical Comparison of Perceptual Scores Between Video Types

| Group 1               | Group 2               | t-statistic | p-value  | KS statistic | p-value  | Significant Difference |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:------------:|:--------:|:----------------------:|
| Carla                 | Two-Stage MA-SST-DDPG | -13.5004    | <0.0001  | 0.4951       | <0.0001  | Yes                    |
| Carla                 | Real world            | -13.6295    | <0.0001  | 0.5294       | <0.0001  | Yes                    |
| Two-Stage MA-SST-DDPG | Real world            | -0.0902     | 0.9282   | 0.0588       | 0.8732   | No                     |

### ✅ Interpretation

- Participants **easily distinguished** between **Carla baseline** and both **real** and **Two-Stage MA-SST-DDPG** videos (significant differences).
- However, there was **no statistically significant difference** between the **Two-Stage MA-SST-DDPG** videos and the **real-world** videos (p = 0.9282).
- This confirms that our model-generated interactions were perceived as **visually indistinguishable from real-world behaviors**, validating the realism and effectiveness of our learned near-miss simulation framework.
